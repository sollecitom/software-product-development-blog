Today I want to talk about a subject close to my heart: burnout. As usual, I believe I'm going to offer a contrarian take, so buckle up.

# What burnout means

Job burnout is a state of emotional, physical, or mental exhaustion.

Burnout can have serious consequences, including frequent illness, disengagement and detachment, insomnia, feelings of frustration, helplessness, anger or irritability, hopelessness, and loss of motivation.

How can you tell if you might be experiencing job burnout? Ask yourself:

1. Have you become cynical or critical at work?
2. Do you drag yourself to work and have trouble getting started?
3. Have you become irritable or impatient with co-workers, customers or clients?
4. Do you lack the energy to be consistently productive?
5. Do you find it hard to concentrate?
6. Do you lack satisfaction from your achievements?
7. Do you feel disillusioned about your job?
8. Are you using food, drugs or alcohol to feel better or to simply not feel?

# The usual explanations

Common explanations for job burnout include:

1. If you work long hours or have an excessive workload.
2. When a job is monotonous or chaotic, you need constant energy to remain focused, which can lead to fatigue and job burnout.
3. Lack of rewards and acknowledgement. If you don't get recognized and compensated enough for your efforts. 
4. Poor self-care: not taking care of yourself outside of work.
5. Juggling many things at once: work, family, study, etc.

# Why everybody talks about it

TODO

- companies think it's about employees, and are worried because of productivity
- types of burnout: frenetic, under-challenged, worn-out
- it's all about "when you feel", never "why you feel"
