Metrics and indicators are amazing when used appropriately. But problems arise when people either:

1. Use metrics as targets. I wrote a [post about this](https://sollecitom.github.io/software-product-development-blog/posts/2023/2023-07-09-management-by-objectives-is-wishful-thinking/), so I'm not going to explain why this is the case again.
2. Focus exclusively on things that can be measured, while neglecting things that cannot.
3. Adopt metrics without understanding their context. I wrote a [post McKinsey's nonsense about software development productivity](https://sollecitom.github.io/software-product-development-blog/posts/2023/2023-08-31-developer-productivity-fuss/), so I'm not going to expand on this either.
4. Don't factor in any delays between inputs and outputs.
5. Believe they need metrics in order to manage anything.

Today I want to challenge the last point, that you need metrics in order to manage anything.

## The trend

The obsession companies have with metrics is getting worse. "OKRs", "KPIs", "data-driven" are on everyone's mouth. Companies even go as far as creating roles, teams, and departments responsible for defining and tracking metrics across the whole company.

This creates a lot of problems, and when people bring these up, complaining about this obsessing behaviour and its consequences, the usual weaponized quote is that "you cannot manage what you cannot measure".

## The 3M Rule of Management

On the contrary, I propose the following 3M Rule of Management:

> "If you cannot Manage what you cannot Measure, then you're a Moron."

## A bit of theory

Before we dig deeper into why I believe you don't need metrics to manage, let's go over a few definitions.

### Measurement

> The process of associating numbers with physical quantities and phenomena.

Measurements concern themselves with quantities. Not every type of feedback is quantitative. Keep this in mind, because it'll be important in a bit.

### Management

> The process of dealing with or controlling processes, things, or people.

I argue that management is exclusively about processes, but let's not diverge. Management is about steering something to produce desired outcomes.

### Moron

> Silly or unwise; showing poor judgment or little intelligence.

With the word "moron", I mean someone that struggles with boilerplate and routine activities.

## A counter-example

If it was true that "you cannot manage what you cannot measure", we'd be hard-pressed to find examples of people successfully managing without metrics.

And if we could easily find examples where normal people could successfully manage without measurements, then it'd imply that a person not capable of managing what they cannot measure would be a moron.

I hope everybody would recognize that people spend their entire life managing things they cannot measure. Some make pretty good examples:

- Relationships with other people, including spouses or partners, children, parents, siblings, co-workers, friends, etc.
- Eating and drinking.
- Dressing yourself according to the weather.

But I want to give a longer explanation of how nonsensical this notion that you cannot manage what you cannot measure is, to clear all doubts.

I'm originally from Italy, so it's time to talk about pasta.

## Back to software product development

TODO

Software product development is incredibly more complex than cooking some pasta.

There are entire dimensions of added complexity, including:

1. It's done in teams, working together.
2. The subject is far removed from the realm of common sense and experiences.
    - An untrained person knows nothing about it.
    - Good and bad products and software are not immediately recognizable, unlike food.
3. It's much longer term.
    - You don't often get to start from scratch
    - Software products and systems get continuously evolved and adapted to new requirements.
    - What you did in the past influences and limits what you can do in the future.
4. The landscape changes continuously.
    - After tomatoes made their way to Europe, the recipe for pasta with fish and tomato sauce stayed virtually unchanged. Even the tools are roughly the same.
    - In software, things change continuously. Entire paradigms appear and force everybody to shift. Cloud providers, containers, orchestrators, infrastructure as code, etc.
5. The scale of the system is much larger.
    - The recipe for pasta with fish and tomato sauce might involve 10 ingredients or so.
    - A software product might involve 10s or 1000s of systems, features, and moving parts.
