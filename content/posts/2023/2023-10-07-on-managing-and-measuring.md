Metrics and indicators are amazing, when used appropriately. But problems arise when people either:

1. Use metrics as targets. I wrote a [post about this](https://sollecitom.github.io/software-product-development-blog/posts/2023/2023-07-09-management-by-objectives-is-wishful-thinking/), so I'm not going to explain why this is the case again.
2. Focus exclusively on things that can be measured, while neglecting things that cannot.
3. Adopt metrics without understanding their context. I wrote a [post McKinsey's nonsense about software development productivity](https://sollecitom.github.io/software-product-development-blog/posts/2023/2023-08-31-developer-productivity-fuss/), so I'm not going to expand on this either.
4. Don't factor in any delays between inputs and outputs.
5. Believe they need metrics in order to manage anything.

Today I want to challenge the last point, that you need metrics in order to manage anything.

## The trend

The obsession companies have with metrics is getting worse. "OKRs", "KPIs", "data-driven" are on everyone's mouth. Companies even go as far as creating roles, teams, and departments responsible for defining and tracking metrics, across the whole company.

This creates a lot of problems, and when people bring these up, complaining about this obsessing behaviour and its consequences, the usual weaponized quote is that "you cannot manage what you cannot measure".

## The 3M Rule of Management

On the contrary, I propose the following 3M Rule of Management:

> "If you cannot Manage what you cannot Measure, then you're a Moron."

## A bit of theory

Before we dig deeper into why I believe you don't need metrics to manage, a few definitions.

### Measurement

> The process of associating numbers with physical quantities and phenomena.
