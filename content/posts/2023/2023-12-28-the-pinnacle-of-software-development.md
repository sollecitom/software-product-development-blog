People talk a lot about the various technical practices, like Test-Driven Development, Ensemble Programming, and Trunk-Based Development. And yet not many people seem to be talking about how these practices work together in synergy.

This is problematic, because these are parts of your system of work, and what matters is the overall effectiveness of how you deliver software. Well, how you deliver software is a subsystem of product development, which is itself a subsystem of your business, but let's focus on software development for now.

And if you compare different systems of work for software development, how can you assess their effectiveness? You'd have to assess them based on the properties they produce. Do you get the properties that you want? And do you get any undesired properties as well?

# Desired properties for a software development system of work

In general, an effective system of work sustainably maximizes the value delivered while meeting the needs of all the folks that matter. But how do you know whether a system of work does that? These are the properties such a system should display:

1. Deliver value to the company's customers and users. The value is how significantly a company improves the lives of its customers. The more value delivered, the better. 
2. Deliver value earlier and more frequently. Value builds up over time, so software delivered earlier produces more value than software landing at a later time. Sooner, more frequently, and more evenly is better.
3. Control risk (reputation, security, compliance, legal, business continuity, etc.). This means preventing bugs, live incidents, downtime, vulnerabilities, etc. Here I didn't say "minimize", because it's about maximizing value while keeping risk acceptable, not the other way around.

[//]: # (TODO)

- Ensure all the needs of the folks that matter are met.
- Maximize the well-being of the people involved.
- Minimize rework and failure demand from not meeting the needs.
- Avoid building the wrong thing (that nobody needs or wants) / building the right thing (that people need and want).
- Keep the effort involved in changing the software stable. If something takes twice as long as it would have taken a year before, this endangers the company.
- Remain capable of concentrating effort on any product or technical area. Over-specialization within a team and across teams endangers this.
- Being resilient to temporary absences and to the occasional team member leaving the company.
- Minimize waste. An activity is wasteful if it doesn't contribute to any of these properties.
- Minimize the number of people employed. More people equal to higher cost and coordination effort.
- Continuous development.
