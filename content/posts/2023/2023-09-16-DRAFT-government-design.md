# Have you ever wondered how you would design a government?

Well, I have. I think it makes for a terrific system design exercise. It's both crazy and fun.

## Context

### The brief

The goal of the exercise is to come up with a description of how an effective government would operate. Pretty simple, uh?

This is an idealised system design exercise, meaning that you should let your imagination run unfettered by how things are today. You start from a blank slate.

The only constraint is that things should be at least theoretically feasible. No imaginary technology, no assumptions that people and other states would behave any differently then they do today.

### Structure of this document

This document contains 3 sections:

1. Thoughts about the goal of an ideal government, with questions, my own personal answers to these questions, and principles.
2. A possible operating model for such a government: principles, practices, and challenges.
3. A redesign of the UK government, with changes that would be introduced, etc.

### Notes before we begin

1. These are my own personal ideas. When I say "ideal", I mean "ideal, in my own opinion".
2. I change my own ideas often. I'm playing here, but I don't want to offend anybody with this exercise. So if you find something that doesn't resonate with you, feel free to let me know, but assume I hate you or anything.
3. This is an exercise that lends itself to countless interpretations, yielding dramatically different results even across people from a similar background. I'd love to read your version of an idealised system design for a government. So why don't you try this? Even better, you could do it before reading the rest of this post, leading to comparing ideas after you're done.
