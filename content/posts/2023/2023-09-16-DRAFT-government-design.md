# Have you ever wondered how you would design a government?

Well, I have. I think it makes for a terrific system design exercise. It's both crazy and fun.

# Context

## The brief

The goal of the exercise is to come up with a description of how an effective government would operate. Pretty simple, uh?

This is an idealised system design exercise, meaning that you should let your imagination run unfettered by how things are today. You start from a blank slate.

The only constraint is that things should be at least theoretically feasible. No imaginary technology, no assumptions that people and other states would behave any differently then they do today.

## Structure of this document

This document contains 3 sections:

1. Thoughts about the goal of an ideal government, with questions, my own personal answers to these questions, and principles.
2. A possible operating model for such a government: principles, practices, and challenges.
3. A redesign of the UK government, with changes that would be introduced, etc.

## Notes before we begin

1. These are my own personal ideas. When I say "ideal", I mean "ideal, in my own opinion".
2. I change my own ideas often. I'm playing here, but I don't want to offend anybody with this exercise. So if you find something that doesn't resonate with you, feel free to let me know, but don't assume I hate you or anything.
3. This is an exercise that lends itself to countless interpretations, yielding dramatically different results even across people from a similar background. I'd love to read your version of an idealised system design for a government. So why don't you try this? Even better, you could do it before reading the rest of this post, leading to comparing ideas after you're done.

# Exercise

## A government is a system

- A government is a social system.
- Its containing system is its country.
- A country is made of the following sub-systems:
    - People (composition, number, average age, genetics).
    - Government.
    - Geography (resources, climate, neighboring countries).
    - History (culture, past events, cuisine, language, etc.).
- The people, government, geography, and history of a country are interdependent.
- The effectiveness of a system is never the sum of its parts, but the product of their interactions.
- Q: could the effectiveness of a government stay the same across different containing systems? A: no.
- Q: is there even a point in doing an idealised system design exercise for a government, without fixing the containing environment? A: I believe there is, because tactics and details would change, but purpose and principles would stay the same.

## The identity of a government

- In social systems, people and teams change over time.
- The way people think determines how they behave, and people are influenced by the existing way of thinking.
- Q: how do we define the identity of a government? When is a government not the same government anymore? A: a government is the same as long as its purpose and its belief system remain the same.

## Continuity: a pre-requisite for achieving outcomes

- If a government is substituted by a different government with a separate purpose or belief system, then its work will be undone.
- This happens because people do what they think is best, so if your definition of best differed from the one of your predecessors, you'd undo their work by doing what you believe it's best.
- As a result, continuity of a government's identity is a pre-requisite for achieving outcomes. Alternating different purposes and beliefs every few years prevents anything good from ever being achieved.
- Q: does this mean that the same government should ideally persist through the ages? A: yes, the alternative is unlikely to produce anything good.
- Q: how do you keep a government that doesn't change accountable of its conduct to its people? Q: can another body keep the government accountable? A: No, as one would end up controlling the other.
- Q: how do you avoid the risk of stagnation in its belief system, if it's important that it doesn't change? A: the belief system can and should change and evolve, but not fundamentally.
- Q: how do you decide who's part of the government, and who is not?

## The purpose of a government

- Q: what is the purpose of a government? A: it is to ensure that its People thrive.
- Q: who are a government's People: the law-abiding citizens of the Country the government is a subsystem of.
- Q: what does "to thrive" mean in this context? A: it means living life to its fullest, including:
    - Remaining in good health.
    - Having shelter and security.
    - Possessing a functional understanding of the world.
    - Being able to raise a family.
    - Meeting their needs to explore and live other places, being able to travel, nationally and internationally.
    - Fulfilling their yearning for purpose by meaningfully contributing to society through work:
        - Something they're good at.
        - Something society needs.
        - Something they enjoy.
- Q: so why have a government at all? What happens if you don't have one? A: without a government people wouldn't have the incentives to focus on things that don't benefit them directly, including everything that spans longer than their lifetime. Collective human knowledge wouldn't have developed without governments. Also, without a well-functioning government, some people would harm other people to satisfy their individual desires, without anything deterring them.

## Some beliefs about people

- A country is a system, and its people are a subsystem. Each person is, in turn, a part of the people of a country.
- For a system to be effective, the parts need to not be optimised in isolation. The goal is to optimise the whole, not the parts.
- This means that what's best for the whole must come before what's best for a part.
- Q: does this mean that there's no place for the will of the individual in an ideal society? A: no, it doesn't. A government's purpose is the well being of its people, so negating the desires and needs of the people would never work. Also, people behave very differently when their needs are fully met, and people's collective behaviour has a huge influence on the effectiveness of a society.
- Q: where's the boundary then? What do you encourage or discourage? A: a government needs to meet the needs of its people, not their desires or their preferred ways of getting those needs met. When someone purposely prevents somebody else's needs to be met by pursuing their desires, they're working against society, so this needs to be discouraged.
- Under the right circumstances, and with the right education, most people behave well as part of society.
- Some people might need repeated corrections to develop a right belief system and behaviour.
- There are people around the world who, simply put, don't seek to do the right thing, but purse their own desires, regardless what. Usually this is because of their background of experiences, it's not that they're intrinsically evil or something. Nonetheless, an effective government must deal with these people so that they don't disrupt its society and country.

## Government organisational principles

- A government must ensure that its people do the right thing, and that they do the thing right.
- Of the two, doing the right thing is tremendously more important.
- Doing this requires knowing what the right thing is (including changes over time), how to do things right, and being able to influence people's behaviour.
- A government must make doing the right thing as convenient and beneficial to the individual as possible, and make doing the wrong thing as inconvenient and detrimental to the individual as possible.
- If this is done well, drastic interventions are rarely needed.
- A government needs information about what's happening in order to perform its role effectively.
- The only way to achieve this is to bring the decision making as close as possible to where the information is gathered.
- Knowing how to do the thing right requires constant experimentation.
- Standardising an approach guarantees that a better one won't be discovered and adopted in a timely enough manner to be effective.
- So, a government should avoid centralising the decision making at the top, and having local breaches enforce decisions made far away from the context.
- Instead, a government should organise itself in circles, in an outside-in fashion. Local circles are responsible for governing their local communities, and can experiment with different approaches. Moving inside, larger circles govern provinces to ensure the interests of a local community don't harm the needs of the province. Till the core of the government, which ensures the interests of a region won't harm the needs of the nation.
- Based on their operating level, circles have different focus, scope, and time horizon.
- It's important to discourage competition and conflicting interests within a circle.
- Competition among circles on the same level should also be discouraged. Innovations and performance should be recognised, but this shouldn't penalise less effective circles.
- A circle that's doing well should be helping circles that do less well improve. It's key that this should be requested by the struggling circle, rather than mandated from a higher level circle. Encouragement is needed, but enforcement shouldn't be necessary.
- Separating responsibilities within a circle is a bad idea. This can easily create conflicts and competition within the circle itself.
- Instead, a circle should be co-responsible for its area of management, across all functions, including coming up with laws and regulations, making plans and executing on those plans, arbitrating over disputes, policing, educating, etc.
