# Have you ever wondered how you would design a government?

Well, I have. I think it makes for a terrific system design exercise. It's both crazy and fun.

# Context

## The brief

The goal of the exercise is to come up with a description of how an effective government would operate. Pretty simple, uh?

This is an idealised system design exercise, meaning that you should let your imagination run unfettered by how things are today. You start from a blank slate.

The only constraint is that things should be at least theoretically feasible. No imaginary technology, no assumptions that people and other states would behave any differently then they do today.

## Structure of this document

This document contains 3 sections:

1. Thoughts about the goal of an ideal government, with questions, my own personal answers to these questions, and principles.
2. A possible operating model for such a government: principles, practices, and challenges.
3. A redesign of the UK government, with changes that would be introduced, etc.

## Notes before we begin

1. These are my own personal ideas. When I say "ideal", I mean "ideal, in my own opinion".
2. I change my own ideas often. I'm playing here, but I don't want to offend anybody with this exercise. So if you find something that doesn't resonate with you, feel free to let me know, but don't assume I hate you or anything.
3. This is an exercise that lends itself to countless interpretations, yielding dramatically different results even across people from a similar background. I'd love to read your version of an idealised system design for a government. So why don't you try this? Even better, you could do it before reading the rest of this post, leading to comparing ideas after you're done.

# Exercise

## A government is a system

- A government is a social system.
- Its containing system is its country.
- A country is made of the following sub-systems:
    - People (composition, number, average age, genetics).
    - Government.
    - Geography (resources, climate, neighboring countries).
    - History (culture, past events, cuisine, language, etc.).
- The people, government, geography, and history of a country are interdependent.
- The effectiveness of a system is never the sum of its parts, but the product of their interactions.
- Q: could the effectiveness of a government stay the same across different containing systems? A: no.
- Q: is there even a point in doing an idealised system design exercise for a government, without fixing the containing environment? A: I believe there is, because tactics and details would change, but purpose and principles would stay the same.

## The identity of a government

- In social systems, people and teams change over time.
- The way people think determines how they behave, and people are influenced by the existing way of thinking.
- Q: how do we define the identity of a government? When is a government not the same government anymore? A: a government is the same as long as its purpose and its belief system remain the same.

## Continuity: a pre-requisite for achieving outcomes

- If a government is substituted by a different government with a separate purpose or belief system, then its work will be undone.
- This happens because people do what they think is best, so if your definition of best differed from the one of your predecessors, you'd undo their work by doing what you believe it's best.
- As a result, continuity of a government's identity is a pre-requisite for achieving outcomes. Alternating different purposes and beliefs every few years prevents anything good from ever being achieved.
- Q: does this mean that the same government should ideally persist through the ages? A: yes, the alternative is unlikely to produce anything good.
- Q: how do you keep a government that doesn't change accountable of its conduct to its people? Q: can another body keep the government accountable? A: No, as one would end up controlling the other.
- Q: how do you avoid the risk of stagnation in its belief system, if it's important that it doesn't change? A: the belief system can and should change and evolve, but not fundamentally.
- Q: how do you decide who's part of the government, and who is not?

## The purpose of a government

- Q: what is the purpose of a government? A: it is to ensure that its People thrive.
- Q: who are a government's People: the law-abiding citizens of the Country the government is a subsystem of.
- Q: what does "to thrive" mean in this context? A: it means living life to its fullest, including:
    - Remaining in good health.
    - Having shelter and security.
    - Possessing a functional understanding of the world.
    - Being able to raise a family.
    - Meeting their needs to explore and live other places, being able to travel, nationally and internationally.
    - Fulfilling their yearning for purpose by meaningfully contributing to society through work:
        - Something they're good at.
        - Something society needs.
        - Something they enjoy.
- Q: so why have a government at all? What happens if you don't have one? A: without a government, people wouldn't have the incentives to focus on things that don't benefit them directly, including everything that spans longer than their lifetime. Collective human knowledge wouldn't have developed without governments. Also, without a well-functioning government, some people would harm other people to satisfy their individual desires, without anything deterring them.

## Some beliefs about people

- A country is a system, and its people are a subsystem. Each person is, in turn, a part of the people of a country.
- For a system to be effective, the parts need to not be optimised in isolation. The goal is to optimize the whole, not the parts.
- This means that what's best for the whole must come before what's best for a part.
- Q: does this mean that there's no place for the will of the individual in an ideal society? A: no, it doesn't. A government's purpose is the well-being of its people, so negating the desires and needs of the people would never work. Also, people behave very differently when their needs are fully met, and people's collective behaviour has a huge influence on the effectiveness of a society.
- Q: where's the boundary then? What do you encourage or discourage? A: a government needs to meet the needs of its people, not their desires or their preferred ways of getting those needs met. When someone purposely prevents somebody else's needs to be met by pursuing their desires, they're working against society, so this needs to be discouraged.
- Under the right circumstances, and with the right education, most people behave well as part of society.
- Some people might need repeated corrections to develop a right belief system and behavior.
- There are people around the world who, simply put, don't seek to do the right thing, but purse their own desires, regardless of what. Usually this is because of their background of experiences, it's not that they're intrinsically evil or something. Nonetheless, an effective government must deal with these people so that they don't disrupt its society and country.

## Government organizational principles

- A government must ensure that its people do the right thing, and that they do the thing right.
- Of the two, doing the right thing is tremendously more important.
- Doing this requires knowing what the right thing is (including changes over time), how to do things right, and being able to influence people's behaviour.
- A government must make doing the right thing as convenient and beneficial to the individual as possible, and make doing the wrong thing as inconvenient and detrimental to the individual as possible.
- If this is done well, drastic interventions are rarely needed.
- A government needs information about what's happening to perform its role effectively.
- The only way to achieve this is to bring the decision-making as close as possible to where the information is gathered.
- Knowing how to do the thing right requires constant experimentation.
- Standardising an approach guarantees that a better one won't be discovered and adopted in a timely enough manner to be effective.
- So, a government should avoid centralizing the decision-making at the top, and having local breaches enforce decisions made far away from the context.
- Instead, a government should organize itself in circles, in an outside-in fashion. Local circles are responsible for governing their local communities, and can experiment with different approaches. Moving inside, larger circles govern provinces to ensure the interests of a local community don't harm the needs of the province. Till the core of the government, which ensures the interests of a region won't harm the needs of the nation.
- Based on their operating level, circles have different focus, scope, and time horizon.
- It's important to discourage competition and conflicting interests within a circle.
- Competition among circles on the same level should also be discouraged. Innovations and performance should be recognized, but this shouldn't penalize less effective circles.
- A circle doing well should be helping circles that do less well improve. It's key that this should be requested by the struggling circle, rather than mandated from a higher level circle. Encouragement is needed, but enforcement shouldn't be necessary.
- Separating responsibilities within a circle is a bad idea. This can easily create conflicts and competition within the circle itself.
- Instead, a circle should be co-responsible for its area of management, across all functions, including coming up with laws and regulations, making plans and executing on those plans, arbitrating over disputes, policing, educating, etc.

## Principles about various government aspects

### Systemic and cross-cutting approach

- Circles organize the government in terms of jurisdiction and level of focus.
- Each circle is headed by a single person.
- Within a circle, there's no division of responsibility for various aspects like healthcare, education, infrastructure, etc.
- Desired outcomes inform the design of vertical aspects e.g. wanting to distribute clean and safe drinkable water informs how water production, large-scale distribution, and endpoint distribution are designed overall.
- Desired outcomes inform the design of horizontal aspects e.g. wanting to prevent crime informs how education, healthcare, entertainment, infrastructure, policing, and justice work.
- Systems are designed to prevent problems from manifesting in the first place, rather than to accept them and fight them.
- Systems are still equipped to deal with problems, but high levels of undesired outcomes are highly undesired, even when kept under control.
    - As an example, a government in need of many prisons is doing things wrong.

### High-level goals

The government aims at fully meeting the needs of its people and its Country. This includes:

- Everybody should have access to the essential resources they need: housing, food, water, energy, information, etc.
- Citizens should be in excellent health, both mentally and physically.
- People should know how the world works, what's happening, and what happened.
- The Country should be self-sufficient, without the need to import or export anything from or to other Countries.
- The success of the government is measured by the welfare of the least privileged people, and by how narrow the gap is between the folks doing worst and the ones doing best.

### Classification of products and resources

- The government should classify products and services according to the following scale, and act according to their classification:
    - Controlled: provided by the government without any private alternative allowed.
    - Essential: provided by the government, but private alternatives are allowed.
    - Encouraged: not provided by the government, but the government encourages private companies to provide these.
    - Neutral: not provided, discouraged, or encouraged by the government. Private companies can provide these.
    - Discouraged: not provided by the government, not outlawed, but private companies are discouraged to provide these.
    - Outlawed: not provided by the government, and private companies are not allowed to provide these either.

#### Controlled

The government exclusively provides controlled products and services. The rationale is that private interests would inevitably damage the interests of the collective if allowed to get near these products or services.

Controlled products and services tend to include the most essential things, and products or services that could cause harm to society when uncontrolled. Some examples include:

- Water, including treatment, packaging, and distribution.
- Essential food: production and distribution of all whole foods (meat, fish, vegetables, fruits, eggs, milk, yogurt), bread, pasta, rice, etc.
- Medicines. This means private medicine producers or vendors are not allowed.
- Healthcare, including dental, but excluding cosmetic treatments. This means that private healthcare providers are not allowed.
- Essential vitamins and supplements in general.
- Electricity, gas, and all energy-related resources. Production, packaging, and distribution.
- Rubbish collection, disposal, and recycling.
- Essential transportation, including all domestic flights and trains, underground, buses, etc.
- Currency: emission, storage, withdrawal, transfers, lending, and borrowing. This means that private providers of basic financial services are not allowed.
- Information and communications: content, distribution, and access. This includes essential news (e.g. excluding sports, etc.), internet connectivity, phone lines, and search engines.
- Essential education: universal minimal education. This includes university, meaning that private education is only allowed for subjects not deemed essential.
- Lottery and all forms of gambling. These are not outright prohibited, as they might entertain when controlled, but no private providers are allowed.
- Drugs. Not sure whether these should be banned altogether or severely controlled, but in any case private interests should be kept away from them.
- All public infrastructure (roads, cables, bridges, etc.).

As an example, allowing private interests to produce and sell essential food would create a conflict. A producer and seller of apples would want to make the apple as sellable and as profitable as possible. These objectives go directly against the interests of the consumers. It'd mean that apples would become sweeter, get more harmful substances on them, etc.

#### Essential

Essential products and services are provided by the government, but private alternatives are allowed, provided they meet some criteria.

- Social media.
- Peer-to-peer communication apps.
- Cloud providers.
- Phones, digital book readers, digital note takers.
- Digital libraries (everything except fiction).
- Houses.
- Hair dressers.
- Childcare.
- Essential clothes.
- Essential accessories and tools.
- Essential physical training services, including gyms (flexibility, weight lifting), martial arts academies, swimming pools, etc.
- Essential mental well-being services, including counseling, and meditation.
- House repairs.
- Specialised and/or advanced education for essential areas.
- Essential weapons and ammunition.

The criteria the government would enforce should prevent private interests from damaging the interest of the people and the Country.

Whenever a private company would provide a significantly better service compared to the government, the government would eventually adopt this as part of their core offering. The company would be invited by the government to run the service, and to scale it to be nationwide. In this sense, the interests of the company wouldn't be harmed.

#### Encouraged

Encouraged products and services are not provided by the government, and private companies are encouraged, provided they meet some criteria. Companies that don't meet these criteria are prohibited from offering these products and services.

The government encourages private providers of these vendors and services by significantly reducing their tax duties.

- Theatres.
- Comedy clubs.
- Cinemas.
- Digital libraries (fiction).
- Specialised and/or advanced education for non-essential areas.
- Social clubs.
- Tourism agencies.
- Holiday organisers.

#### Neutral

The government doesn't provide or encourage these products and services. Private companies that do so must still adhere to guidelines and regulations.

- Non-essential clothes.
- Non-essential surgery (e.g. cosmetic).
- Non-essential accessories and tools.
- Restaurants.
- Sex services.
- Go-karts, mud races, etc.
- Video games.
- Non-essential weapons and ammunition.

#### Discouraged

Discouraged products and services are not provided by the government, and private companies that offer them are discouraged with a higher tax rate.

- Harmful foods e.g., highly processed, alcohol, high in sugar, etc.

#### Outlawed

Outlawed services and products are not provided by the government, and no private companies are allowed to provide these either. Consumption and possession are also outlawed.

- Cigarettes, cigars, vaping, etc.
- Drugs of any kind: marijuana, cocaine, amphetamines, opioids, etc.
- Forbidden weapons and ammunition.

### Policies for government-provided services and products

Whenever the government provides products and services, the following principles apply:

- The services and products are organized and produced according to their demand.
- Quality and affordability are heavily prioritized over the range of selection. Affordability here is considered over time, so durable products and services that fully meet the needs are preferred.
- The government should offer services and products that are high-quality and are affordable. People don't want choice, but things they can afford and work well.
- The government should not over-produce goods. This means that makers and factories should be setup to produce a wide range of products, as opposed to large-scale production of a few item types. 

### Education

- The goal of education is to maximize the potential of every citizen.
- Schools should identify the strengths of each student, and then encourage them, to bring out curiosity and desire to learn.
- Education should equip everybody with the knowledge and skill they need to thrive.
- Mandatory education is full-time from age 5 to age 16. From age 17 to age 25, education is part-time, and people are required to both work and study.
- Education is both free and mandatory.
- Full-time education includes essential life skills, how the world works, critical thinking, and what happened in the world, including:
    - Reading
    - Writing
    - Cleaning
    - Cooking
    - Recycling
    - Swimming (till proficient)
    - Climbing
    - Survival (starting fires, hunting, makeshift gear, finding food, etc.)
    - Fighting (hand-to-hand, stick, knife, firearms, etc.)
    - Maths
    - Physics
    - Biology
    - Anatomy
    - Chemistry
    - Philosophy
    - Systems thinking
    - Psychology
    - Debate
    - History
    - Geography
- Some subjects are introduced after a few years (e.g., fighting, and survival), others fade after a while (e.g., reading, cleaning, and recycling), while others continue throughout (e.g., maths and physics).
- There are no scores or rankings.
- Nobody can fail a year.
- The goal is to achieve a functional level of proficiency in all subjects, and a great degree of skill in those subjects the student is gifted at.
- Part-time education pushes those skills a person is gifted at to extreme levels, pending existing demand for those skills at that time.
- Teaching is provided by groups of various experts, working together in related subjects e.g., maths and physics; survival, climbing, and swimming; various fighting aspects; history and geography, etc.
- Teachers are periodically inspected and evaluated based on how well the students are doing.
