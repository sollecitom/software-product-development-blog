What do you think a description of the ideal employee might look like, at your company?

Far too often, what companies have in mind is:

> Somebody who is hardworking, respectful, reasonable, modest, loyal, calm, humble, and a team player. Someone who smiles, is kind to everybody, is always on time, estimates accurately, follows the process, considers others' opinions, never shouts or gets angry, disagrees and commits.

A lapdog, ready to comply with anything the company throws at them, content with scraps, making no fuss, and posing no threat. Sit down, roll over, good boy, have a biscuit.

So why are companies keen on lapdogs? Who would want to hire a mediocre, boring, flat pushover? It usually means that the hiring manager is also a lapdog, or a leech, rather than a wolf.

Why are we talking about animals now? It turns out that the employees in a company are either wolves, lapdogs, or leeches. 

> Note: While the names might sound harsh, these are just models. Also, People aren't born one way or another, but choose how to behave, and this can change, even if this happens rarely. As it always goes with models, these are approximations useful to understand certain aspects, but that's the limit of their applicability.

# The three archetypes

## Wolves

Wolves are about hunting and their pack. They're strong, fierce, and wild.

Employees with this archetype enjoy solving problems with their peers. You point them in a direction, or they'll find problems themselves, pay them enough to live comfortably, and they'll move mountains.

These employees tend to be highly autonomous, extreme, allergic to rules, and a bit rough around the edges. Wolves are capable and want to continuously get better.

Primary motivators: fun, stretching themselves, teamwork, working with great people.

## Lapdogs

Lapdogs are meek, loyal, and mediocre. 

Employees with this archetype value job security above all else, and hate venturing outside their comfort zone. You give them stability, the occasional treat, and they'll do whatever you tell them to do, eagerly and to the letter.

These employees readily comply with processes, are averse to any kind of change, and never challenge authority. Lapdogs are consciously incompetent, so they gave up trying to be of value by pushing things, and decided to attempt to please everybody instead. 

Primary motivators: conflict avoidance, job security, routine work, hiding their incompetence.

## Leeches

Leeches are sly, selfish, and always scheming.

Employees with this archetype value their own personal power the most, in terms of influence and direct control over others. They'll worm their way up the career ladder, siphon the company's resources, and play empire building.

These employees use every occasion to increase their personal power and to harm or discredit people in their way. They never challenge directly, preferring to undermine people with whispered lies. Leeches are also consciously incompetent, but decided to play a different game, politics, which allows them to advance and thrive without having to be good at anything but backstabbing and lying.

Primary motivators: personal power, climbing the ladder, controlling others, hiding their incompetence and hidden motives.

# The dynamics between the three archetypes

It's useful to have a look at the dynamics between employees with different archetypes, to understand why certain things tend to play out the way they do, inside companies.

## Wolves -> wolves

Wolves play along very well with other wolves. The teams of wolf-type employees are loud, informal, and close-knit. Wolves talk a lot, laugh a lot, and debate things fiercely. These teams tend to also be the most diverse, as people strong at something naturally team up with others who possess different strengths.

## Wolves -> Lapdogs

Wolves dislike and have no respect for lapdogs, but they don't usually actively seek conflict with them. The only exceptions are:

- When a lapdog joins a team of wolves, the team will resent them, and eventually push them out.
- When a lapdog finds themselves overseeing a team of wolves, the lack of respect inevitably creates conflicts over time.
- When lapdogs act defensively, as they feel threatened by the wolves, and ask senior management to force the wolves to comply with the process.

## Wolves -> Leeches

Wolves hate leeches, but they don't go out of their way to initiate conflict with them.

They clash in the same cases they clash with lapdogs, but the skirmishes are much more intense, and get triggered quicker.

## Lapdogs -> Lapdogs

Lapdogs live well with other lapdogs, even if they mildly compete among them for scraps and attention. In any case, it's a silent squabble, as lapdogs dread the anger of their masters.

Even when they band together, lapdogs don't tend to form strong bonds among themselves. Groups of lapdogs are usually quiet, with everybody grinding in isolation. Their passions tend to live outside of work, so they mostly discuss about politics, football, etc.

## Lapdogs -> Wolves

Lapdogs are afraid of wolves --- TODO (pretending to be a wolf to feel okay with themselves, a sheep in wolf's clothes)

-- TODO as managers

# What companies should aim for

- none of them cares about the company
TODO (wolves tend to leave if they feel under-challenged, caged, or if they don't value their pack; leeches can sometimes leave if they feel they can gain more elsewhere; lapdogs very rarely leave)
(if left on its own, this causes a proliferation of lapdogs, with a few leeches in power, and it's terminal)

TODO wolves, leeches, and lapdogs

- leeches love mediocrity
- having them work on their own, not as teams (better control)
- treating them as interchangeable
- Lapdogs envy the wolves and feel threatened by them
- Wolves hate lapdogs
- Lapdogs get hired by other lapdogs, or by sheep that play politics
- Sheep fear wolves the most
