What do you think a description of the ideal employee might look like, at your company?

Far too often, what companies have in mind is:

> Somebody who is hardworking, respectful, reasonable, modest, loyal, calm, humble, and a team player. Someone who smiles, is kind to everybody, is always on time, estimates accurately, follows the process, considers others' opinions, never shouts or gets angry, disagrees and commits.

A lapdog, ready to comply with anything the company throws at them, content with scraps, making no fuss, and posing no threat. Sit down, roll over, good boy, have a biscuit.

So why are companies keen on lapdogs? Who would want to hire a mediocre, boring, flat pushover? It usually means that the hiring manager is also a lapdog, or a leech, rather than a wolf.

Why are we talking about animals now? It turns out that the employees in a company are either wolves, lapdogs, or leeches. 

> Note: While the names might sound harsh, these are just models. Also, People aren't born one way or another, but choose how to behave, and this can change, even if this happens rarely. As it always goes with models, these are approximations useful to understand certain aspects, but that's the limit of their applicability.

# The three archetypes

## Wolves

Wolves are about hunting and their pack. They're strong, fierce, and wild.

Employees with this archetype enjoy solving problems with their peers. You point them in a direction, or they'll find problems themselves, pay them enough to live comfortably, and they'll move mountains.

These employees tend to be highly autonomous, extreme, allergic to rules, and a bit rough around the edges. Wolves are capable and want to continuously get better.

Primary motivators: fun, stretching themselves, teamwork, working with great people.

## Lapdogs

Lapdogs are meek, loyal, and mediocre. 

Employees with this archetype value job security above all else, and hate venturing outside their comfort zone. You give them stability, the occasional treat, and they'll do whatever you tell them to do, eagerly and to the letter.

These employees readily comply with processes, are averse to any kind of change, and never challenge authority. Lapdogs are consciously incompetent, so they gave up trying to be of value by pushing things, and decided to attempt to please everybody instead. 

Primary motivators: conflict avoidance, job security, routine work, hiding their incompetence.

## Leeches

Leeches are sly, selfish, and always scheming.

Employees with this archetype value their own personal power the most, in terms of influence and direct control over others. They'll worm their way up the career ladder, siphon the company's resources, and play empire building.

These employees use every occasion to increase their personal power and to harm or discredit people in their way. They never challenge directly, preferring to undermine people with whispered lies. Leeches are also consciously incompetent, but decided to play a different game, politics, which allows them to advance and thrive without having to be good at anything but backstabbing and lying.

Primary motivators: personal power, climbing the ladder, controlling others, hiding their incompetence and hidden motives.

# The dynamics between the three archetypes

It's useful to have a look at the dynamics between employees with different archetypes, to understand why certain things tend to play out the way they do, inside companies.

## Wolves -> wolves

Wolves play along very well with other wolves. The teams of wolf-type employees are loud, informal, and close-knit. Wolves talk a lot, laugh a lot, and debate things fiercely. These teams tend to also be the most diverse, as people strong at something naturally team up with others who possess different strengths.

## Wolves -> Lapdogs

Wolves dislike and have no respect for lapdogs, but they don't usually actively seek conflict with them. The only exceptions are:

- When a lapdog joins a team of wolves, the team will resent them, and eventually push them out.
- When a lapdog finds themselves overseeing a team of wolves, the lack of respect inevitably creates conflicts over time.
- When lapdogs act defensively, as they feel threatened by the wolves, and ask senior management to force the wolves to comply with the process.

## Wolves -> Leeches

Wolves hate leeches, but they don't go out of their way to initiate conflict with them.

They clash in the same cases they clash with lapdogs, but the skirmishes are much more intense, and get triggered quicker.

## Lapdogs -> Lapdogs

Lapdogs live well with other lapdogs, even if they mildly compete among them for scraps and attention. In any case, it's a silent squabble, as lapdogs dread the anger of their masters.

Even when they band together, lapdogs don't tend to form strong bonds among themselves. Groups of lapdogs are usually quiet, with everybody grinding in isolation. Their passions tend to live outside of work, so they mostly discuss politics, football, etc.

## Lapdogs -> Wolves

Lapdogs are afraid of wolves, as they fear their incompetence will be either called out explicitly, or exposed by the staggering difference of results the wolves produce. 

A typical defense tactic is to claim that the wolves do better because they break the sacred rules they religiously follow. Another frequent one is carving an area exclusively for themselves, so that they can claim special circumstances apply there. Every approach that works can easily be dismissed on the basis that it might work elsewhere, but that it could never work in their domain.

Lapdogs secretly hate their job and envy wolves, their freedom, their competence, and their team dynamics. Wolves are everything they wish they were, and they spend a lot of time trying to convince themselves they are indeed wolves.

## Lapdogs -> Leeches

Lapdogs readily recognize leeches as their natural masters. They're eager to please, in exchange for scraps and a pat on the head. The implicit agreement is that lapdogs will do whatever leeches tell them to, in exchange for the promise of a quiet and comfortable life.

They dread a clash with anyone with power, so they wag their tail and do whatever they're told, even when it affects them and their peers negatively. In these cases, lapdogs will go as far as sacrificing other lapdogs to the leech, typically to shield them from blame or embarrassment.

## Leeches -> Lapdogs

Leeches love lapdogs, as they allow them to hide their incompetence and schemes, and pose no threat whatsoever. All leeches have to do is play nice, with the occasional cruel demonstration of power, and lapdogs will enlist to their own private army.

## Leeches -> Wolves

Leeches hate wolves and will actively try to get rid of them, as they pose a threat. Leeches will try everything: foster disagreement within a team, badmouth the team, try to claim their credit, try to blame them for their own failures, etc.

Leeches secretly envy wolves, just like lapdogs do. But unlike lapdogs, leeches know well the game they play.

## Leeches -> Leeches

Leeches behave with other leeches based on the difference in power wielded. A leech will actively serve another if they have no chance to prevail yet. But they'll try to gain enough power to eventually backstab their master.

A more established leech will gladly work with less powerful leeches, as long as they're not a threat yet, because they can use them to advance their own agendas, just like they use lapdogs. The tradeoff is that lapdogs are safer, while other leeches are more useful.

## Wolves as executives/directors/managers 

A wolf in a position of power is usually a great force multiplier. They rally people with their vision and passion, get rid of lapdogs and leeches, and push everybody to give it all and accomplish amazing things.

They're often tremendous, both intimidating and inspiring, and are usually hands-on, because they're still motivated by having fun while solving hard problems with other great people.

## Lapdogs as executives/directors/managers

A lapdog in a position of power is usually a lackey put there to keep things quiet. They tend to pretend they're something they're not, a sheep in wolf's clothing, but they know nobody respects them.

Sometimes their insecurity and fear of being called out is so crippling that they end up behaving like babies, pushing arbitrary rules and initiatives on people, to try and demonstrate to themselves that they actually matter.

## Leeches as executives/directors/managers

A leech in a position of power is a calamity, even if it's unfortunately quite common. -- TODO

# What companies should aim for

- none of them cares about the company
TODO (wolves tend to leave if they feel under-challenged, caged, or if they don't value their pack; leeches can sometimes leave if they feel they can gain more elsewhere; lapdogs very rarely leave)
(if left on its own, this causes a proliferation of lapdogs, with a few leeches in power, and it's terminal)

TODO wolves, leeches, and lapdogs

- leeches love mediocrity
- having them work on their own, not as teams (better control)
- treating them as interchangeable
- Lapdogs envy the wolves and feel threatened by them
- Wolves hate lapdogs
- Lapdogs get hired by other lapdogs, or by sheep that play politics
- Sheep fear wolves the most
- Lapdogs and leeches love bureaucracy
- The typical game is a leech initiating something, giving it to a lapdog to champion, and then either claiming the credit or giving the blame.
- Since lapdogs are attracted to the competent and the powerful, leeches easily win them over, since wolves shun them.
