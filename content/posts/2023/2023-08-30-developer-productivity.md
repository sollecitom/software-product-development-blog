## The controversy about developer productivity

There's a lot of talk and controversy about whether you could measure developer productivity these days. Some very big consultancies are pushing their own framework for it, while some software product development legends are of a different opinion.
The legends are making fun of the consultancies, which are in turn accusing the legends of wanting to dodge accountability for their work.

So who's right? Who's wrong? And why? To answer that we'll have to think a bit.

## A framework to think about developer productivity

In order to reason about measuring developer productivity, we should, first of all, clarify a few points.

1. What is developer productivity? What's its operational definition?
2. Is the productivity of a software developer intrinsic to the person? Completely? Partially? Not at all?
3. Assuming you could measure the productivity of a software product developer, and that it depended on the person entirely, would this be useful? How? To who?

As always, we start with why.

### Imagine you could have it all

TODO imagine you could measure the productivity of a software product developer, what would you do with this information? Would it help? Who?

### Is the productivity of a developer an intrinsic trait?

TODO does productivity intrinsically belong to a person? Or is it largely influenced by the environment e.g. the team, the ways of working, the processes, the manager, and the company?

### Developer productivity: an operational definition

TODO can we operationally define developer productivity? Talk about leverage, delays, collaborative knowledge work.
TODO - some people live in a fantasy world where software product development is a linear game about quantity. Employees produce stuff, and stuff adds up, so outcomes = stuff/sec * employees, and stuff/sec is productivity. Reality is a bit different.
TODO - software developers are service providers: they sell the capability of continuing to change the systems we need to serve our customers, change after change.

## So what?

This controversy is the result of a different world-view. On one side you have Theory-X people, with their internal competition model, claiming you cannot manage what you cannot measure. On the opposite side, you have Theory-Y people, talking about synergies, systems, and culture.
TODO - the first side is a residue from another era, not fit for purpose when it comes to collaborative knowledge work. Software product development is collaborative knowledge work, akin to lawyers, judges, scientists, city planners, advisors, doctors, teachers, and psychologists.
