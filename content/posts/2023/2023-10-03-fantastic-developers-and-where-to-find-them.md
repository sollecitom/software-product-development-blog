All companies look to hire the top talent, don't they? And why wouldn't they? After all, if you hire the best people, you're going to triumph, right?

What does "best" mean in this context though?

Let's start from what it does not mean.

## How most companies hire

TODO

### Criteria

#### All-rounders

TODO (because of working individually)

#### Experience with the tech stack

TODO

#### Experience in the same industry

TODO

#### Loyal

TODO (not changing jobs often, they don't complain about previous employers)

#### CV formatting

TODO (STAR, impact described, etc.)

#### Certifications

TODO

#### Agrees with me

TODO

#### No red flags

TODO (no strong/controversial opinions on socials)

#### Puts up with our nonsense

TODO (works under pressure, deals well with tight deadlines, used to matrix management, writes PRDs, loves OKRs, etc.)

### Overall

A boring, loyal all-rounder who's competent enough to do what they're told, but not competent enough to need convincing. They never raise their voice, get along well with everybody, respect the process, and are reasonable.
