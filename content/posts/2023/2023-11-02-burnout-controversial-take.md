Today I want to talk about a subject close to my heart: burnout. As usual, I believe I'm going to offer a contrarian take, so buckle up.

# What burnout means

Job burnout is a state of emotional, physical, or mental exhaustion.

Burnout can have serious consequences, including frequent illness, disengagement and detachment, insomnia, feelings of frustration, helplessness, anger or irritability, hopelessness, and loss of motivation.

How can you tell if you might be experiencing job burnout? Ask yourself:

1. Have you become cynical or critical at work?
2. Do you drag yourself to work and have trouble getting started?
3. Have you become irritable or impatient with co-workers, customers or clients?
4. Do you lack the energy to be consistently productive?
5. Do you find it hard to concentrate?
6. Do you lack satisfaction from your achievements?
7. Do you feel disillusioned about your job?
8. Are you using food, drugs or alcohol to feel better or to simply not feel?

# The usual explanations

Common explanations for job burnout include:

1. If you work long hours or have an excessive workload.
2. When a job is chaotic, you need constant energy to remain focused, which can lead to fatigue and job burnout.
3. Lack of rewards and acknowledgement. If you don't get recognized and compensated enough for your efforts. 
4. Poor self-care: not taking care of yourself outside of work.
5. Juggling many things at once: work, family, study, etc.

# Why everybody talks about it

It's perhaps unsurprising that job burnout is getting a lot of attention. Everybody talks about it.

Companies offer stress management courses, coaching, more holidays, etc.

However, the reason why they seem to care is purely pragmatic:

1. Burned-out employees are 2.6 times more likely to be actively seeking a different job.
2. Burnout syndrome accounts for a large part of all occupational illness cases.
3. Burned-out workers are way more likely to take a sick day.
4. A report by Gallup and Workhuman discovered turnover and lost productivity due to employee burnout cost businesses around $322bn globally, with the cost of voluntary turnover due to burnout alone being 15% to 20% of the payroll budget each year.

# A burnout epidemic

And yet, job burnout is an epidemic. I don't want to go into this at length, but here are a few bullet points that convey the pervasiveness of the problem:

- American Psychological Association: 3 in 5 workers reported experiencing negative mental and physical impacts due to work-related stress. 26% noted a lack of interest, motivation, or energy, 32% reported emotional exhaustion, and 44% noted high levels of physical fatigue.
- Indeed: more than half (52%) of workers reported feeling burned out, there is a disconnect between the age groups.
- Deloitte: 77% of workers have experienced burnout at their current job.
- Mental Health UK: 46% of workers felt ‘more prone to extreme levels of stress’ compared to the year before, while a massive 1 in 5 reported feeling ‘unable to manage stress and pressure in the workplace.’
- McKinsey Health: a quarter of employees experienced burnout symptoms.
- Mental Health America: 75% of employees experienced burnout.

And it's getting worse, year-on-year burnout grows at about a rate of 5% to 8%.

# The popular model doesn't seem to work

So why is burnout on the rise, despite the increasing efforts companies put to address it? And despite the fact that working conditions are generally getting better?

Think about the factors that are commonly cited as the root cause of burnout, and look at their trend in the software development industry, over the past two decades:

1. Working long hours and excessive workloads. Haven't working hours been shrinking?
2. Unstructured work without clear goals. Hasn't work actually become more structured?
3. Lack of rewards and acknowledgement. Haven't companies been more and more careful with incentives, recognition, and bonuses? 
4. Poor self-care. Isn't there a lot more awareness these days? Mental health days off, coaching sponsored by companies, paid gyms, and private healthcare? 
5. Juggling many things at once. Do you think this got worse over the past 20 years?

So why has burnout continued to rise, even when its stated root causes have improved?

I believe the reason lies in a fundamental lack of understanding of why burnout happens, resulting in an inability to see what the actual root causes are, and how to address the problem.

# The hearth of the problem

Companies are worried because of the loss in productivity and the voluntary attrition. They fundamentally believe that job burnout has to do with the employees, and how they poorly manage the stress they think is intrinsic to the work.

So all the remedies so far have been directed at helping employees cope with the stress. Coaching, counselling, mental health days off, more holidays, more breaks, less weekly hours, more flexibility, TODO

TODO

- companies think it's about employees, and are worried because of productivity
- types of burnout: frenetic, under-challenged, worn-out
- it's all about "when you feel", never "why you feel"
