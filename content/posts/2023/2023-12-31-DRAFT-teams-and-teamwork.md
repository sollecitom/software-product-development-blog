Ask any software developer, and they'll tell you they work in a team. But do they? I worked in quite a few places and, in my experience, working as a team is rare within software companies.

The thing is, teamwork and teams are incredibly misunderstood. The terms themselves are very often abused, so that a team, these days, is just a fancier name for "a group of co-workers".



TODO

- Everybody thinks they work in a team.
- But do they?
- Most people can't articulate what a team is.
- The definition of a team.
- Why it matters.
- Teams are more than the sum of the parts. It's about effectiveness AND efficiency.
- Working as a team is a choice.
- Team vs non-team activities. Examples (Romans, hunting, football, looking for gold, cleaning the streets, etc.)
- Teams limit the freedom of the team members, by definition.
- Teams allow specialization. If you have to work alone, you're forced to be an all-rounder.
- Trivial activities don't require teamwork.
- Software development can be a trivial activity, when the project is small and non-ambitious.
- For large projects, a single individual cannot perform software development. It's not about time, it's about knowledge and understanding.
- For product development it's even worse, because we're after outcomes, not outputs.
- If you believe in teams and teamwork, what changes?
- How you hire.
- How you assign work.
- How you assess performance.
- Incentives.
- Co-location.
