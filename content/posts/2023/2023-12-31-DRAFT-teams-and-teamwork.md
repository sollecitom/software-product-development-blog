Ask any software developer, and they'll tell you they work in a team. But do they? I worked in quite a few places and, in my experience, working as a team is rare within software companies.

The thing is, teamwork and teams are incredibly misunderstood. The terms themselves are very often abused, so that a team, these days, is just a fancier name for "a group of co-workers".

I believe that many of the problems companies experience derive from this misunderstanding, and from putting in place practices that are anti-systemic and destroy teamwork.

So what's a team then? A team is a social system, and as such it is a qualitatively different entity than a few individuals working alone side-by-side.

To understand what this means, let's look at what "system" and "social" mean, in this context.

## What a team actually is

When it comes to the definition of a system, I could never explain it better than by quoting Russell Ackoff:

- "A system is a whole that consists of parts each of which can affect its behavior or its properties. Each part of the system when it affects the system is dependent for its effect on some other part. In other words: The parts are interdependent."
- "No part of the system or a collection of parts of the system has an independent effect on it. Therefore, a system as a whole cannot be divided into independent parts."
- "The essential or defining properties of any system are properties of the whole which none of its parts have. The essential property of an automobile is that it can carry you from one place to another. No part of an automobile can do that."
- "Therefore, when a system is taken apart it loses its essential properties. A system is not the sum of the behavior of its parts, itâ€™s a product of their interactions. The performance of a system depends on how the parts fit, not how they act taken separately."

About the word "social", Russell Ackoff, once again, categorized any system as either:

- A machine, where the overall system has no purpose, and neither have the parts. A machine serves the purpose of its creator.
- An organism, where the overall system has its own purpose, but the parts do not.
- A social system, where the overall system has its own purpose, and the subsystems also have their own purposes.

Therefore, a social system is a system whose parts have their own purpose. The beliefs and behaviors in a team are interdependent, and this interdependence develops and evolves over time, in a reciprocal manner. 

Most of the issues and the dysfunction companies experience derive from either:

1. Treating companies, teams, and people as if they were machines, forgetting that they have their own purposes.
2. Dealing with companies and teams in an anti-systemic way, by focusing on the parts, rather than on the system as a whole.

Today though, I want to discuss how most "teams" within software companies aren't working as a system.

## Why this matters a lot

The reason why teamwork matters a lot is that the difference in effectiveness and efficiency between a team and a group of co-workers can be dramatic.

As an example, people who clean the streets of a city don't typically work as a team. Sure, they all together have breakfast, get to the location, exchange jokes and banter, plan the work, and come back. But this is not enough for a group of people to be called a team. That's because street cleaners divide the work among themselves, and then work in isolation. This works because cleaning streets is a linear activity, so if I clean a street, and you clean another, the overall outcomes are the sum of our individual outcomes. In these circumstances teamwork isn't necessary, and a working group might even be better.

There are many activities, however, where a team might work out much better than a group of co-workers. Keep in mind that this is a choice. A good example is hunting. You can decide to hunt as a group, or as a team.

As a group, you split the work, so I hunt in an area, and you in another. At the end of the hunt, we put together what you and I managed to get, and bring it back to the village. We work in parallel, more efficiently, and cover more ground. What's not to love? Well, as long as we're hunting things that are trivial to hunt, like frogs, this actually works best.

What if we're hunting for something bigger or faster than us though? Perhaps in a dangerous environment with many dangerous predators? Humanity discovered a long time ago the value of working as a team, and that hunting alone was a great way of dying.

TODO


TODO

- Team vs non-team activities. Examples (Romans, hunting, football, looking for gold, cleaning the streets, etc.)
- Teams limit the freedom of the team members, by definition.
- Teams allow specialization. If you have to work alone, you're forced to be an all-rounder.
- Trivial activities don't require teamwork.
- Software development can be a trivial activity, when the project is small and non-ambitious.
- For large projects, a single individual cannot perform software development. It's not about time, it's about knowledge and understanding.
- For product development it's even worse, because we're after outcomes, not outputs.
- If you believe in teams and teamwork, what changes?
- How you hire.
- How you assign work.
- How you assess performance.
- Incentives.
- Co-location.
