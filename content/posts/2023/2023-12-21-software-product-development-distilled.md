Product development is a complex endeavor. It involves identifying a job to be done people struggle with, creating a product that addresses it well, pricing and marketing it appropriately, defending it against competitors, and reacting to market changes, all while making a profit.

Additionally, software is a highly abstract medium, meaning that common-sense rarely applies, so that what's effective is often counter-intuitive.

And so it's perhaps unsurprising that software companies rarely know how to structure themselves and how to operate, leading to many alternative approaches. Startups copy practices from famous businesses, and there's an abundance of consultants and advisors. Commercial frameworks like SAFe or Scrum promise executives that they won't have to think, and that merely applying the framework will produce great results.

And yet, reality isn't linear or clear-cut. What works in another company won't likely work elsewhere. A practice that's effective in a company with 30 employees will almost surely not work when the same company has 100 employees. Systems are full of interdependencies and nonlinearities, so you cannot improve your sales without changing your product and your marketing, and you cannot change who you hire without changing how you work.

So what should a company do? When common sense doesn't work, frameworks aren't effective, and copying what famous businesses are doing won't take you far? TODO
