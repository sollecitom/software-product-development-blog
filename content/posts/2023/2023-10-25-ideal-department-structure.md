I often talk at length about what I don't like. Today, instead, I want to explain how I believe a software product development department should be structured and operate.

<U>Note 1</u>: this article focuses exclusively on the software product development department. Not on the whole company. This leaves aside important considerations about the interdependencies between the various departments, but we can discuss those another time.
<U>Note 2</u>: B2B and B2C companies have many differences, but I don't believe the software product department should operate in a fundamentally different way.

# The nature of the game

A good software product development department derives from a good understanding of what the game is about. First and foremost, it's not about building things. Building things is part of the game, but is not the purpose.

The idea is finding ways to unblock your customers, allowing them to progress towards something important to them, which they're struggling to achieve. Nobody wants, buys, or cares about your product. They care about their goal, want to achieve it, and buy your product because it allows them to achieve what they want.

The single most important aspect for a company to turn out successful is finding the right problem to address. Something enough people find important enough to pay enough for your product. The biggest competition usually comes from non-consumption.

Finding the right problem to solve is the biggest hurdle, but not the only one. Building a product that fully meets the needs of your customers is also important, and features can both improve or damage your product's ability to serve your customers well.

The product development department exists to accomplish these two cornerstones of every successful product company.

B2B companies that get this wong sell based on features they don't have, then rush to build those features they promised to close the deal. Artificial deadlines are always there, as things were promised with a due date. B2C companies can also turn themselves into feature factories, by focusing on what their product is and does, rather than on its reason of existence.

So, first and foremost, the product teams should be responsible for discovering problems worth solving, opportunities worth chasing, and solutions that can delight the company's customers. If done well, the customers should be willing to compensate the company with more of their money, time, or loyalty.

This doesn't mean that product teams should do whatever they want, as a company has still an overall identity and focus. But it does mean that teams shouldn't be asked to implement pre-determined solutions to pre-identified problems.

# The importance of theoretical models

Good product development departments balance learning and building. Startups tend to suffer and often disappear because they have too many ideas and initiatives, not too few.

The correct product lifecycle should be:

1. An opportunity is discovered. Typically, this is hypothesized from the theoretical model, or it emerges from looking at the data or from interviewing customers.
2. The opportunity is documented in a knowledge base.
3. The opportunity is validated against the company's focus and identity. The outcome is registered in the knowledge base.
4. The value associated with the opportunity is determined. This involves making assumptions about various things, including how important things are for customers, and how much they'd be willing to pay (in terms of time, attention, and loyalty).
5. These assumptions are tested. Building things can be a way to test assumptions, but it's by far the worst way of accomplishing this.
6. The value associated with the opportunity is confirmed. The opportunity receives a cost of delay, which is the amount of money lost or not made until the opportunity is addressed. All of this is updated into the knowledge base.
7. An opportunity is identified as the next strategic focus.
8. Multiple solutions are proposed for the selected opportunity. Each solution is estimated in terms of viability (e.g., would it be viable from a business' perspective? would it make us money? would it put us at risk legally?) and feasibility (e.g., could we build it? how long would it take? do we need to develop new capabilities to do this? would this introduce new technologies? could we maintain it?).
9. The solutions are logged into the knowledge base, along with their feasibility and viability notes.
10. A solution is selected, based on how well it'd meet the customers' needs, its feasibility, and its viability.
11. The solution is implemented in thin vertical slices.
12. Customer feedback is gathered as the solution is built, in a way that it's quick enough to invalidate any assumptions about the value of the opportunity, and the feasibility, viability, and usability of the solution.
13. The developed features and capabilities are documented in the knowledge base.
14. The solution is evaluated in terms of meeting the customers' needs and addressing the opportunity it was supposed to address.

The whole product lifecycle is performed by the software product development organization.
