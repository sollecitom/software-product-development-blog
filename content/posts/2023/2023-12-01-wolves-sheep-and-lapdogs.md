What do you think a description of the ideal employee might look like, at your company?

Far too often, what companies have in mind is:

> Somebody who is hardworking, respectful, reasonable, modest, loyal, calm, humble, and a team player. Someone who smiles, is kind to everybody, is always on time, estimates accurately, follows the process, considers others' opinions, never shouts or gets angry, disagrees and commits.

A lapdog, ready to comply with anything the company throws at them, content with scraps, making no fuss, and posing no threat. Sit down, roll over, good boy, have a biscuit.

So why are companies keen on lapdogs? Who would want to hire a mediocre, boring, flat pushover? It usually means that the hiring manager is also a lapdog, or a leech, rather than a wolf.

Why are we talking about animals now? It turns out that the employees in a company are either wolves, lapdogs, or leeches. 

> Note: While the names might sound harsh, these are just models. Also, People aren't born one way or another, but choose how to behave, and this can change, even if this happens rarely. As it always goes with models, these are approximations useful to understand certain aspects, but that's the limit of their applicability.

# The three archetypes

## Wolves

Wolves are about hunting and their pack. They're strong, fierce, and wild.

Employees with this archetype enjoy solving problems with their peers. You point them in a direction, or they'll find problems themselves, pay them enough to live comfortably, and they'll move mountains.

These employees tend to be highly autonomous, extreme, allergic to rules, and a bit rough around the edges.

## Lapdogs

Lapdogs are meek, loyal, and mediocre. 

Employees with this archetype value job security above all else, and hate venturing outside their comfort zone. You give them stability, the occasional treat, and they'll do whatever you tell them to do, eagerly and to the letter.

These employees comply with processes to the letter, are averse to any kind of change, and would never challenge authority.

## Leeches

Leeches are sly, selfish, and always scheming.

Employees with this archetype value their own personal power the most, in terms of influence and direct control over others. They'll worm their way up the career ladder, siphon the company's resources, and play empire building.

These employees use every occasion to increase their personal power and to harm or discredit people in their way. They never challenge directly, preferring to undermine people with whispered lies.  

# The dynamics between the three archetypes

TODO

# What companies should aim for

- none of them cares about the company
TODO (wolves tend to leave if they feel under-challenged, caged, or if they don't value their pack; leeches can sometimes leave if they feel they can gain more elsewhere; lapdogs very rarely leave)
(if left on its own, this causes a proliferation of lapdogs, with a few leeches in power, and it's terminal)

TODO wolves, leeches, and lapdogs

- leeches love mediocrity
- having them work on their own, not as teams (better control)
- treating them as interchangeable
- Lapdogs envy the wolves and feel threatened by them
- Wolves hate lapdogs
- Lapdogs get hired by other lapdogs, or by sheep that play politics
- Sheep fear wolves the most
