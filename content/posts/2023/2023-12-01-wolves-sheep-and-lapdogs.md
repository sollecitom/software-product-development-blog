What do you think a description of the ideal employee might look like, at your company?

Far too often, what companies have in mind is:

> Somebody who is hardworking, respectful, reasonable, modest, loyal, calm, humble, and a team player. Someone who smiles, is kind to everybody, is always on time, estimates accurately, follows the process, considers others' opinions, never shouts or gets angry, disagrees and commits.

A lapdog, ready to comply with anything the company throws at them, content with scraps, making no fuss, and posing no threat. Sit down, roll over, good boy, have a biscuit.

So why are companies keen on lapdogs? Who would want to hire a mediocre, boring, flat pushover? It usually means that the hiring manager is also a lapdog, or a leech.

A leech? Why are we talking about animals now? It turns out that the employees in a company can be categorized as wolves, lapdogs, and leeches. As it always goes with models, these are approximations useful to understand certain aspects, but that's the limit of their applicability.

TODO wolves, leeches, and lapdogs

- leeches love mediocrity
- having them work on their own, not as teams (better control)
- treating them as interchangeable
- Lapdogs envy the wolves and feel threatened by them
- Wolves hate lapdogs
- Lapdogs get hired by other lapdogs, or by sheep that play politics
- Sheep fear wolves the most
