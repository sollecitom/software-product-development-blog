What do you think a description of the ideal employee might look like, at your company?

Far too often, what companies end up having in mind is:

> Somebody who is hardworking, respectful, modest, calm, humble, empathetic, and a team player. Someone who smiles, is kind to everybody, is always on time, estimates accurately, follows the process, considers others' opinions, never shouts or gets angry, disagrees and commits.

Basically, a semi-competent lapdog, ready to comply with anything the company throws at them, content with scraps.
