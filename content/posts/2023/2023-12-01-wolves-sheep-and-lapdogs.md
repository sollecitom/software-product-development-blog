What do you think a description of the ideal employee might look like, at your company?

Far too often, what companies end up having in mind is:

> Somebody who is hardworking, respectful, modest, loyal, calm, empathetic, humble, and a team player. Someone who smiles, is kind to everybody, is always on time, estimates accurately, follows the process, considers others' opinions, never shouts or gets angry, disagrees and commits.

Basically, a mediocre lapdog ready to comply with anything the company throws at them, content with scraps, making no fuss, and posing no threat.

TODO

- having them work on their own, not as teams (better control)
- treating them as interchangeable
- Lapdogs envy the wolves and feel threatened by them
- Wolves hate lapdogs
- Lapdogs get hired by other lapdogs, or by sheep that play politics
- Sheep fear wolves the most
