Product development is a complex endeavor. It involves identifying a job to be done people struggle with, creating a product that addresses it well, pricing and marketing it appropriately, defending it against competitors, and reacting to market changes, all while making a profit.

Additionally, software is a highly abstract medium, meaning that common-sense rarely applies, so that what's effective is often counter-intuitive.

And so it's perhaps unsurprising that software companies rarely know how to structure themselves and how to operate, leading to many alternative approaches. Startups copy practices from famous businesses, and there's an abundance of consultants and advisors. Commercial frameworks like SAFe or Scrum promise executives that they won't have to think, and that merely applying the framework will produce great results.

And yet, reality isn't linear or clear-cut. What works in another company won't likely work elsewhere. A practice that's effective in a company with 30 employees will almost surely not work when the same company has 100 employees. Systems are full of interdependencies and nonlinearities, so you cannot improve your sales without changing your product and your marketing, and you cannot change who you hire without changing how you work.

So what should a company do? When common sense doesn't work, frameworks aren't effective, and copying what famous businesses are doing won't take you far?

The answer is that you should write down a set of principles that derive from your belief system, and then use these to orient yourself in this highly complex environment. A belief system is a set of fundamental beliefs that shapes the way you perceive reality and link causes to consequences.

You should evaluate the coherence of your belief system and your principles overall. So if two beliefs or principles conflict, you should think deeper and evolve them, until the conflict disappears.

> What follows is some of my personal beliefs when it comes to software product development. I stand by them, and they served me well over the years, but I keep evolving them, and you shouldn't take them at face value. The important thing is that you write down your beliefs, evaluate them as a whole system, write down your principles, and use them to orient yourself when designing how your company operates.

# Belief system

1. A software product is a set of promises, not a set of features.
2. Customers hire your product to do a job they would otherwise attempt to do in other ways.
3. Product development is about finding a good job to be done, and tailoring your product to meet the customers' needs well, given the circumstances your users find themselves in.

I wrote down quite a few organizational principles in [a previous article](https://sollecitom.github.io/software-product-development-blog/posts/2023/2023-11-16-organizational-principles-for-effectiveness/). These principles derive from my current belief system, so they won't resonate if you hold a different set of beliefs.
