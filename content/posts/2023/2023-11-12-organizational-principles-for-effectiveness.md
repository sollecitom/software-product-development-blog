I often discuss what's wrong with an approach, practice, or system. Today, for a change, I want to clarify some principles that an effective software product development company should adopt.

Why principles? Wouldn't a detailed description of how things should work be more useful?

It'd be almost impossible to write, as it's a colossal task. Perhaps it'd be good for a book, but definitely not for a blog post.

Also, reality is multifaceted and nuanced. Everything depends on everything. Prescriptive approaches cope poorly with dynamic situations. Principles, on the other hand, allow you to deal with uncertainty, and guide your decision-making by cutting out the noise.

# How to use these principles

You can use these principles to design how a whole company operates. When choosing tradeoffs, approaches, and practices, check whether the element you're designing violates one of the principles. If it does, design an alternative approach that doesn't.

The principles work in synergy, so the value they bring when implemented together is more than the sum of the parts, but they're individually useful. That means you can apply them to designing not only whole organizations, but also departments, areas, and teams.

At the very least, they provide a framework to evaluate how effective a company or a team is.

# Applicability

Like any model, these principles have specific applicability boundaries. They're only useful when:

1. There's a willingness to strive for excellence. If a company is content with doing okay, some of these will sound extreme or dangerous.
2. The results are placed before what's better for some people. The non-goals include keeping people in their comfort zone, supporting control structures, and feeding people's ego.

# Principles

## The company is structured outside-in

People work across different levels. Activities range from being closest to the customers, to the innermost level. The time horizons tend to widen as the levels get further from the customers.

The inner levels support the outer levels. It's about coordination, not command or management. The outer levels can pull help from the inner levels, but the decision-making stays with the people working as close as possible with the customers.

The opposite of this is the traditional top-down organization, where each level controls and manages the level below.
