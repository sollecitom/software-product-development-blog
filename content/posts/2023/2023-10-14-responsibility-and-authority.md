The ubiquitous way of structuring companies is by nesting areas of responsibility.

You create well defined problems and roles, and give them to people, so that each area or concern has exactly 1 person responsible for it.

The nesting bit comes when these areas roll up into other areas. So if someone is responsible for hiring, they might decide to further spread this responsibility across roles or geographies. So you might have someone responsible for hiring software developers in London, rolling up into a UK hiring lead, rolling up into a global talent partner, rolling up into a chief operating officer.

I'm not a fan of this model, but it wouldn't be that bad if it stopped at responsibility, meaning that the person responsible focuses on that area.
The real problem arises when people are made accountable for the area they get assigned to.
