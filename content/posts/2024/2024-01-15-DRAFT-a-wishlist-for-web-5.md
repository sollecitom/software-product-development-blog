Skeleton:

- Lot of hype for AI these days, but will it change anything meaningful?
- In technology there are often hype cycles about things, but society rarely changes.
- There are many important aspects e.g., energy production and distribution, food, etc., but let's focus on information systems today.
- There was a lot of talk about Web 3 and all the changes it should have brought. Let's assume we got tired of NFTs, unicorns, and mini-ponies with Web 4, and we actually wanted to improve something with Web 5.
- This post is a wishlist for how Web 5 could work, to make people's life easier.

Features:

- Quantum-secure cryptography e.g., Kyber for key encapsulation mechanism, and Dilithium for signatures.
- Identity registry with public keys.
    - De-centralized with Trust-Based Acceptance (TBA*).
    - Backed by centralized services for convenience.
