TODO

- This July General Elections will be as depressing as the one between Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbin.
- Is it really a democracy if you're bound to choose between two awful alternatives?
- The Tories work relentlessly to empty every public service until it's an unrecognisable shell, ready to be given to their friends' private companies to "rescue" it.
- Labour pushes this ideology where certain category of people should be de-facto allowed to do whatever they want, despite the laws in vigour.
- The UK has collapsed over the past 10 years, both socially and economically.
- What if these two options were two faces of the same medal? What if the medal was a morally corrupt political class equally unwilling and incapable of pursuing what's good for the citizens of the country they are called to administer?
- Why do we need to put up with the greed, incompetence, dishonesty, and hypocrisy that are destroying our society?
- There are changes we desperately need, but nobody is even discussing them, and even merely mentioning this would attract trouble.

1. Introduce a constitution, declaring the fundamental individual rights and governing principles.
2. Abolish nobility, of all sorts. Expropriate all the properties and assets of these people. Change all names tied to the concept of nobility e.g. HMRC.
3. Abolish the concept of political parties. Allow only individual representatives.
4. Abolish the two Houses of Parliament. Replace them with a single Chamber of 100 individual representatives.
5. TODO something to give the government continuity.
6. Ditch the doctrine of precedent and common law. Stick to legislative enactments and civil law. This thing that judges can overturn laws should stop.
7. Separate the responsibility of deciding the political direction and of writing the laws. The 100-people Chamber should decide the direction, and a newly instituted office should be responsible to adjust the set of laws to reflect the will of the elected representatives. The number of laws should be kept at a minimum.
8. Scrap all historical laws, and start from scratch. No more references to laws established 500 years ago in a completely different context.
9. Abolish physical currency.
10. Create a state-owned national digital banking service, providing checking accounts, debit cards, and account-to-account payments to everybody, for free.
11. Outlaw the need of filing a self assessment for employees. Create laws that force companies to disclose employment details to the tax bureau, and banks to inform the bureau of any transactions.
12. Create a single digital identity scheme. Create a distributed ledger with remote backup for information, allowing people and organizations to request and access information, provided the person approves. Abolish passports, driving licenses, etc.
13. Outlaw the possibility of taking any amount of money from a bank account without the approval of the account owner. For recurring payments, the approval should be given every time the money needs to leave the account.
14. Heavily invest in getting self-sufficient in terms of food production. Leverage research and high-tech facilities to produce essential foods.
15. Work towards getting self-sufficient in terms of energy and recycling.
16. Create a state-owned supermarket. Essential foods, water, medicines, tools, clothes, etc. should be sold at zero-profit prices. The principle here is to offer high-quality affordable essentials to everybody. Exclude all highly processed products.
17. Introduce the concept of a desired target for the population, based on self-sufficiency objectives and national resources. Derive other policies e.g. immigration from this.
18. Introduce a zero-tolerance policy for illegal immigration. Only let people actually needed in, with individual vetting. People should only be let in if there are margins in terms of self-sufficiency.
19. Create local administrations with cross-functional responsibilities across justice, policing, legislation, etc. Align them centrally, but give them ample discretion to run their area. These state representatives should be able to make decisions (law enforcement, judiciary, etc.). Citizens can decide to appeal against such decisions, with penalties if a higher jurisdiction confirms the original call.
20. Introduce a zero-tolerance policy against crime and anti-social behavior. Re-introduce stop and search, etc. Increase the powers the police has. Mercilessly punish all power abuses.
21. Create a state-owned internet access program, with high-speed connectivity (through optical fiber, etc.), free for everybody.
22. Introduce a state-owned email service, free for everybody, tied to the single national identity. Do the same for calendar and appointments, video calls, file storage, and GPS maps navigation. Abolish landlines and the mobile network.
23. Introduce a state-owned identity provider service, so that people can federate their digital identity across all services, both government-owned and run by third parties.
24. Ban all written communications via mail, replacing them with email communications through the nationwide service.
25. Create a state-owned housing company. Build high-quality essential homes for everybody, on demand, at cost price. Introduce a zero-interest mortgage scheme, where money is taken as part of income tax directly, over 40 years.
26. Outlaw the possibility of owning more than one house. Expropriate the additional initial houses some people own, with financial compensation.
27. Rebrand the HMRC as Internal Tax Service. Reform it to operate in a fully digital economy. Nobody should declare their taxes. Companies should report incomes paid to people, and transactions should be monitored.
28. Drop all financial support to religious institutions (of all sorts). Close all religious schools. Close all religious sites. Introduce multi-faith religious sites run by the government.
29. Reform the NHS to provide effective preventive and corrective care to everybody, for free, including dental. Only exclude cosmetic and gender-affirming medicine.
30. Outlaw private medicine (all sorts). Hire all private doctors into the NHS.
31. Restructure how medicine works, with local cross-functional centers operating preventive and corrective action. Introduce periodic checks for everybody, free vitamins programs, etc. Local centers should be able to take care of most common conditions, to operate minor surgeries, etc.
32. Reform the prison system. Differentiate the control measures based on the type of inmates. Make the inmates work toward reaching zero-cost for prisons. Structure the time served around hard work, study, and picking up new skills.
33. Introduce a mandatory permit to make a baby. Release permits based on sustainability and self-sufficiency targets. People who have fewer kids should precede people who have more in the queue. Make having an unsanctioned baby a crime.
34. Introduce harsher punishment for crimes committed by immigrants. Deport any immigrant who committed a crime, at the end of their prison sentence.
