TODO

- This July General Elections will be as depressing as the one between Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbin.
- Is it really a democracy if you're bound to choose between two awful alternatives?
- The Tories work relentlessly to empty every public service until it's an unrecognisable shell, ready to be given to their friends' private companies to "rescue" it.
- Labour pushes this ideology where certain category of people should be de-facto allowed to do whatever they want, despite the laws in vigour.
- The UK has collapsed over the past 10 years, both socially and economically.
- What if these two options were two faces of the same medal? What if the medal was a morally corrupt political class equally unwilling and incapable of pursuing what's good for the citizens of the country they are called to administer?
