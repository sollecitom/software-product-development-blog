This morning I went for a walk and witnessed how London is regressing, rather than improving. This prompted me to think deeper about what I believe the problem is, and what I would do to fix it.

I have to admit that this is a highly unusual post for me, as I usually stay away from politics. And yet, I love a good debate, so I see no reason why I shouldn't write about this as well.

Rather than the usual long explanations about systems, today I'll play it differently. What follows is what I would do if I were in a position to unilaterally change things in the UK.

# Changes

1. Abolish nobility (all sorts), expropriate all their properties and monetary assets.
2. Abolish the concept of political parties. Allow only individual representatives.
3. Abolish the two Houses of Parliament. Replace them with a single Chamber of 100 individual representatives.
4. TODO something to give the government continuity.
5. Ditch the doctrine of precedent and common law. Stick to legislative enactments and civil law.
6. Separate the responsibility of deciding the political direction and of writing the laws. The 100-people Chamber should decide the direction, and a newly instituted office should be responsible to adjust the set of laws to reflect the will of the Chamber.
7. Create a state-owned national digital banking service, providing checking accounts, debit cards, and payments to everybody, for free. Abolish currency.
8. Create a single digital identity scheme. Create a distributed ledger with remote backup for information, allowing people and organizations to request and access information, provided the person approves. Abolish passports, driving licenses, etc.
9. Outlaw the possibility of taking any amount of money from a bank account without the approval of the account owner. For recurring payments, the approval should be given every time the money needs to leave the account.
10. Heavily invest in getting self-sufficient in terms of food production. Leverage research and high-tech facilities to produce essential foods.
11. Create a state-owned supermarket. Essential foods, water, medicines, tools, clothes, etc. should be sold at zero-profit prices. The principle here is to offer high-quality affordable essentials to everybody. Exclude all highly processed products.
12. Introduce a zero-tolerance policy for illegal immigration. Only let people actually needed in, with individual vetting. People should only be let in if there are margins in terms of self-sufficiency.
13. Create local administrations with cross-functional responsibilities across justice, policing, legislation, etc. Align them centrally, but give them ample discretion to run their area.
14. Introduce a zero-tolerance policy against crime and anti-social behavior. Re-introduce stop and search, etc. Increase the powers the police has. Mercilessly punish all power abuses.
15. Create a state-owned internet access program, with high-speed connectivity (through optical fiber, etc.), free for everybody.
16. Introduce a state-owner email service, free for everybody, tied to the single national identity.
17. Ban all written communications via mail, replacing them with email communications through the nationwide service.
18.
