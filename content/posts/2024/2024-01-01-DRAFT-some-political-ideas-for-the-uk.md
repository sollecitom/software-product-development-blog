This morning I went for a walk and witnessed how London is regressing, rather than improving. This prompted me to think deeper about what I believe the problem is, and what I would do to fix it.

I have to admit that this is a highly unusual post for me, as I usually stay away from politics. And yet, I love a good debate, so I see no reason why I shouldn't write about this as well.

Rather than the usual long explanations about systems, today I'll play it differently. What follows is what I would do if I were in a position to unilaterally change things in the UK.

# Changes

1. Abolish nobility (all sorts), expropriate all their properties and monetary assets.
2. Abolish the concept of political parties. Allow only individual representatives.
3. Abolish the two Houses of Parliament. Replace them with a single Chamber of 100 individual representatives.
4. TODO something to give the government continuity.
5. Ditch the doctrine of precedent and common law. Stick to legislative enactments and civil law.
6. Separate the responsibility of deciding the political direction and of writing the laws. The 100-people Chamber should decide the direction, and a newly instituted office should be responsible to adjust the set of laws to reflect the will of the Chamber.
7. Create a state-owned national digital banking service, providing checking accounts, debit cards, and payments to everybody, for free. Abolish currency.
8.
