Every morning, I drag myself to the sink, razor in hand, steam curling like a ghost around the fogged glass. The water burns, the blade stings, and for those raw seconds, it’s just me and the truth staring back.

No likes, no clout, no roles, and no polished mask to hide behind. Just my soul and one question: Who are you when no one’s watching?

The world has its playbook, and it’s a bestseller. Write what sells. Chase crypto scams, echo political outrage, praise metrics, or preach AI salvation, whatever trends in the endless scroll.

Tempting, right? Bury your soul, amplify the noise, and watch opportunities stack up like chips on a poker table. Why bleed for your beliefs when you can mimic the mob, toss in buzzwords, and cash in? Smooth your edges, nod to the crowd, and you’re set: doors open, DMs buzz with deals, the siren call of “making it.”

It’s a simple trade: your spine for a seat at a hollow table. I’ve felt that pull, God I still do.

Standing at the cliff’s edge, staring at a blank page, fingers itching to type the words that’d win the room, the gig, the fleeting rush of being “somebody.”

Opportunities dangle like overripe fruit: a viral retweet, a sketchy brand deal, some disinvested advice, a chance to ride the next wave of nonsense. All it takes is a small betrayal.

But every time I lean in, something in me fights back, a fire in my gut, scars on my knuckles, refusing to let me forget who I am.

My beliefs aren’t just opinions to swap like cheap sneakers. They’re the iron in my spine, the grit in my veins, the drumbeat driving me since I decided my voice was worth the fight. Strip them away, and I’m nothing, just another empty hustler grinning for the algorithm, peddling recycled platitudes for pennies.

I’d miss the deals, the keynotes and conferences, the slick promise of exposure. But losing the person in the mirror? That’s a ruin no spotlight can fix.

The world’s a circus of grifters, seats sold out to chameleons with eyes like cash registers. They flip from wellness gurus to crypto gurus to AI prophets, whatever pays fastest.

Some are sharp, spinning opportunism into gold; others are shadows, flailing for scraps because they never stood for anything. Let them have their hustle. Let them wake at forty, faces creased with regret, staring at the flicker they traded for fire.

Not us. Not the holdouts, the heretics too stubborn to bend. We’re no heroes, just battered souls writing what burns us raw, speaking truths that sting the tongue, living with a courage that makes the mirror proud.

We miss out, and it hurts: every ignored post, every slammed door, every empty inbox stings.

But we show up, whole, unbowed, jaded but blazing, because the alternative is a life choking on fakes. In a world that rewards cowards, that’s the only currency that matters: our wild, beating hearts, unapologetic and alive.

So here’s to you, the unbroken rebels, the weary dreamers who stare down the mirror and choose the harder path. This is our anthem, our roar: We won’t sell our souls for silver. We won’t dim our light for likes. We won’t trade our truths for coins or applause.

You, with your ink-stained hands and bruised convictions, you’re the pulse of a world that’s forgotten how to feel, the spark that sets it ablaze. Keep standing. Keep swinging. Keep burning. The opportunities that matter will find you, drawn like moths to the flame you refuse to snuff. And when they do, you’ll walk through those doors not as a shadow, but as a force, carrying every truth you never betrayed.

To the defiant, the pissed-off, the ones who’d rather break than kneel: You’re the rebellion the world needs. Hold fast. The mirror’s a bitch, but it’s the only one telling the truth.

(A nod to Barry O’Reilly's and Marco Consolaro's recent sparks: your words fanned these flames. Keep roaring!)
