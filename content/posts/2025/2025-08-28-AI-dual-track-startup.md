I wonder whether AI can enable a dual track model for building products while finding product market fit.

## The Historical Problem

So far, companies were forced to choose between speed of validation and iteration, and stability, scalability, and maintainability.

And so most companies choose speed of prototyping, hoping to fix these gaps after finding PMF.

A few succeed, while the majority fail, because by then the cost of addressing these issues becomes massive, and rewriting from scratch is always unthinkable. Poor internal abstractions and quality lead to massive slowdowns, sometimes even before PMF is found.

## AI to the Rescue?

Now, with AI prototyping is quicker than ever, but the quality problems remain, and AI doesn't seem to help much with these. 

I wonder whether a dual track approach could now work, where fast prototyping enabled by AI is paired with building a sustainable system in parallel. 

Splitting your employees among these two work streams isn't a new idea, but with AI the effort required to prototype could be significantly lower, leaving more capacity to build solid foundations.

## Hopes for a Better Future

I might be dreaming here, but it feels like it should work well. Whether the industry will ever recognize the importance of internal quality is another story.

What do you think? Does it make sense? Do you see this happening?
