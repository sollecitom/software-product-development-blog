Welcome! If you're passionate about software product development, then this blog is for you!

My love for software product development began a long time ago, and it's still strong today.

I'm Michele, and I blog about Agile methodologies, technical practices, test strategies, software architecture, leadership, and the industry.

That's it, I'm not going to bore you further. Check some posts and let me know what you think!
